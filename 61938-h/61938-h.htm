<p style="text-align: center">This little booklet is dedicated to
the<br />
BRAVE WOMEN OF BURSTON,<br />
who have since April, 1914, nobly<br />
struggled against the tyranny of the<br />
Countryside.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>To understand the things that are at our
door is the best preparation for understanding those that lie
beyond</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hypatia</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sentence the Reverend Charles Kingsley carries forward
the message left by Aristotle.</p>
<p>When preparing to write this little booklet I was greatly
impressed with the above words.&nbsp; No more fitting motto could
I find for it, since it deals with the tyranny of our own country
side.</p>
<p>It is a challenge to autocracy, a protest against injustice
and a warning signal to the teaching profession.</p>
<p>It shows how a simple, moral, God-fearing little community may
be roused into action against parochial busybodies and local
glebe lords.&nbsp; The squire and the rector have been the Lord
High Tololorums of the countryside for centuries.</p>
<p>To dispute their divine authority, or to question their
insolence, oft means social ostracism, or a tour abroad without a
Cook&rsquo;s guide.</p>
<p>Emigration returns will prove this.</p>
<p>The people of Burston, in Norfolk, are deeply religious and
law-abiding.&nbsp; The reverend rector has, however, gone too
far.</p>
<p>Their struggle against him for fifteen months, their brave
devotion and loyalty to their teachers, is almost without
parallel in the history of Nonconformity.</p>
<p>They have seceded from the Church, their children have
voluntarily left the Council School, and the parents, though
fined again and again, have successfully defied that poor
man&rsquo;s Dragon <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>of Wantley&mdash;the Law.&nbsp; The struggle is not yet
concluded, and Heaven knows where and how it will end.</p>
<p>The reverend rector finding teachers, parents, and children
still true to each other, has issued notices to quit at
Michaelmas, next September.</p>
<p>Not succeeding from the religious point of view, he is now
about to try his luck as landowner.</p>
<p>By means of these glebe notices he seeks to remove the bravest
and best so that he may once more hold the destinies of the
villagers in the hollow of his hand.</p>
<p>The purpose of this booklet is to focus the clear white light
of public opinion upon Burston.&nbsp; I believe I voice the wish
of every true woman and man, every lover of justice and genuine
freedom, when I express a hope that he may not succeed.&nbsp; Had
he brought an atom of brotherly love or the true charity which he
quotes on Sundays, or sought to crystallise the true spirit of
Christianity into his dealings with his village folk, then this
booklet would have remained unwritten.</p>
<p>However, it may serve a useful purpose if it only shows other
reverend rectors what they must avoid.</p>
<p>When the teaching profession becomes as wide-awake to its
interests as, say, the dock labourers, the miners, and cotton
operatives, then will its members join their Union, loyally
co-operate with each other, and form a linked breakwater against
oppression.</p>
<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
BURSTON SCHOOL STRIKE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>If the history of England be ever
written by one who has the knowledge and the courage</i>, <i>and
both qualities are equally requisite for the undertaking</i>,
<i>the world would be more astonished than when reading the Roman
annals by Niebuhr</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Earl of
Beaconsfield</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burston village lies eighteen miles south of Norwich.</p>
<p>Four and a half years ago came to this village as
schoolmistress and assistant-master, Mrs. A. K. Higdon, and her
husband, T. G. Higdon.&nbsp; They were welcomed to the Council
School by friends, parishioners, etc.&nbsp; They gained the
affection of the scholars, the approval of the parents, and the
blessing of His Majesty&rsquo;s Inspector.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">The Government
Report,<br />
October 11th, 1912.</p>
<p>The present mistress has had charge of the school a little
over a year and a half, and its condition is very promising.</p>
<p>A good tone prevails; the scholars take a pride in their work,
and the work done in some of the subjects of instruction is very
creditable.</p>
<p>Mental arithmetic is well above the average, and the written
arithmetic of the first class is generally praiseworthy.&nbsp;
The singing and much of the drawing are good, and needlework is
taught on sensible lines.</p>
<p>On the whole the infants and first-class children are making
more progress than the scholars in the middle portion of the
school.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Signed) A. H. <span
class="smcap">Moore</span>, H.M.I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the last Government report under the Higdons&rsquo;
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. T. G. Higdon, the assistant-master, possesses that
dreadful modern incumbrance, a <i>heart</i>.</p>
<p>The Daily Press oft contains an advertisement stating that
&ldquo;Hands are wanted,&rdquo; but if they were to issue an
advertisement <i>re</i> &ldquo;Hearts,&rdquo; the precedent might
prove disastrous to most firms.</p>
<p>Higdon, looking upon the countryside with the eye of a person
married to it, held high hopes of betterment.&nbsp; He could not
help observing the long hours of toil, the scant incomes, the
over-crowding, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>etc., which that noble soul, the Reverend Charles
Kingsley, pictures in &ldquo;Yeast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higdon, after his day&rsquo;s teaching, tramped the country
lanes, and made first-hand acquaintance with the joys and
sorrows, aspirations and hopes of Hodge and his helpmate.&nbsp;
He spoke words of healing and helpfulness to the Lazarus of
civilisation, Carlyle&rsquo;s Dumdrudge, and our poor country
cousins.&nbsp; He saw lean labour, wrinkled, seamed and scarred
by grinding toil, privation, self-denial, and short commons; so,
John Ball-like, he carried the message both on Sundays and
weekdays.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he did not attend the local Sunday
services.</p>
<p>Unlike Longfellow&rsquo;s blacksmith, he did not go on Sundays
to the church to hear his daughter&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; One
reason was that he had no daughter which, of course, makes a deal
of difference, the other reason was that he preached himself.</p>
<p>You require to be a very strong clergyman indeed to permit
competition in well-doing.&nbsp; At any rate, the rector spoke to
Higdon about his non-attendance at church.</p>
<h3>A FEW WORDS ABOUT THIS RECTOR.</h3>
<p>The Rector of Burston, Reverend Charles Tucker Eland, was
appointed to the living about a month after the Higdons took
charge of the Council School.&nbsp; His stipend is &pound;495 per
annum, with rectory house, and fifty-four acres of glebe land
producing &pound;86 yearly (according to Crockford).&nbsp; The
village numbers 315 souls, three of whom, according to latest
information, attended service upon a recent Sunday.&nbsp; Under
these circumstances one may sympathise with his desire to annex a
congregation.</p>
<p>Higdon was cautioned, I suppose, in a friendly
(half-joke-real-earnest) manner.&nbsp; He is very much opposed,
however, to private property in Sundays.</p>
<p>The Reverend Charles suggested that it might be prejudicial to
the school, etc., if the teacher stayed away.</p>
<p>Kings in the past have threatened dire penalties for
non-attendance at church, but when people attend church simply
because the schoolmistress, the wealthy farmer, or the large
employer puts in an appearance, then they show little respect or
love for Divine teaching.&nbsp; Attendance should be a matter of
choice, not compulsion.</p>
<p>Timothy Sparks, who later attained world-wide celebrity by
using his real name, Charles Dickens, issued a quaint little book
upon this subject, entitled &ldquo;Sunday under Three
Heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Robert
Kett, Norfolk rebel, suggested in 1549 &ldquo;that all bondmen
should be made free, for God made all free with his precious
blood-shedding.&rdquo;&nbsp; I presume he meant that this might
also apply to Council School teachers.</p>
<p>He likewise suggested &ldquo;that someone should be appointed
in every parish to teach poor men&rsquo;s children catechism and
the primer; that enclosing of common lands should be put a stop
to; and that priests and vicars who were unable to preach and set
forth the word of God should be removed from their
benefices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a pulpit emptying ordinance this last clause is!</p>
<p>It cost Kett dear.&nbsp; The Earl of Warwick instructed an
army of German mercenaries to pursue him; 3,500 of his Norfolk
followers were cut down, and he was hanged as a rebel for his
presumption.</p>
<p>A rebel is a person who comes on earth before the people are
intelligent enough to understand him.&nbsp; None but a rebel ever
had Saviour carved on his tomb.&nbsp; Had he suggested that
vicars should live up to their teachings we would have classed
him as an Impossiblist, of course.</p>
<p>The keeping of Sunday will always be a matter of controversy
until we in England also &ldquo;Remember the week-day to keep it
holy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, let us move on to the petty persecutions and puny
pretexts for dismissal vouchsafed to Mr. and Mrs. Higdon after
more than three years&rsquo; service and twelve years in the
county.</p>
<p>The Reverend Charles Tucker Eland, to give him his full title,
parted in the middle, departed this Burston village life for a
short holiday in Switzerland.</p>
<p>A clergyman&rsquo;s holiday has two good points.&nbsp; It
gives both him and his congregation a well-earned rest.&nbsp;
Whilst the Reverend School Manager was away in Switzerland, an
epidemic of whooping cough had the audacity to enter the
village.</p>
<p>Mrs. Higdon, the schoolmistress, at once sent over to another
reverend school manager, the Reverend Millard (Rector of
Shimpling and vice-chairman of the local Managers&rsquo;
Committee), and he, after consultation, decided to close the
Council School for one week.&nbsp; <i>He</i> signed the notices,
and made entry in the log to that effect.</p>
<p>When the Rector of Burston arrived back from Mount Pilatus
another meeting of the school managers was held.</p>
<p>This Managers&rsquo; Committee informed Mrs. Higdon, through
the chairman (Reverend C. T. Eland this time) &ldquo;that the
committee took a very serious view of her having closed the
school <i>without</i> permission, but,&rdquo; added the Reverend
Pulpiteer, no doubt in an <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>outburst of holiday extravagance,
&ldquo;the managers will now let the matter drop.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A VERY REVEREND COMMITTEE.</h3>
<p>I think we might here observe a silent pause whilst we
appropriately meditate upon the reverend chairman&rsquo;s logic
and the Managing Committee&rsquo;s generosity.&nbsp; In fact, the
names of the members of the committee should be handed down to
<i>posterity</i>.&nbsp; Here they are:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Burston Council
School</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">The School Managing Committee.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Right Reverend Rector, Charles Tucker
Eland.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Right Reverend Reverend Rector&rsquo;s
good lady.</p>
<p class="gutindent">(<i>County Council</i>, <i>two votes by
appointment</i>.)</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Right Reverend Rector&rsquo;s friend,
the Right Reverend Rector of Shimpling, Reverend Charles
Millard.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Right Reverend Charles Tucker
Eland&rsquo;s glebe tenant, Farmer Fisher.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Right Reverend Rector&rsquo;s
friend&rsquo;s friend, the Rector of Shimpling&rsquo;s
churchwarden, Farmer Stearn, and lastly, beloved, Mr. Harry
Witherly.</p>
<p>A fitting finale to this family party&mdash;I mean Council
School Managing Committee&mdash;was provided by the Right
Reverend Charles Tucker Eland&rsquo;s loyal glebe tenant, Farmer
Fisher, who remarked upon &ldquo;the harm which had been done to
the parish by closing the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Farmer Fisher been a <i>medico</i> one might have
sympathised with him in his sorrow at &ldquo;whooping
cough&rdquo; not being allowed to attend school whilst the rector
was in Switzerland, but as Mr. Fisher is not a medical gentleman
by profession one is forced to the sad conclusion that though he
may put money in his purse he really ought to have more furniture
in his attic.</p>
<p>His theory for the elimination of disease is certainly
original.</p>
<p>Children who may suffer in the future from mumps, whooping
cough, scarlet fever, managers, or any other disease liable to be
captured by juveniles, may say to their parents, &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t keep me at home.&nbsp; Please mother, Mr. Fisher
recommends Council School treatment, so that I may share it with
the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bor.&nbsp; Whoop, whoop, whooping
cough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes!&nbsp; I can safely recommend a little attic salt.&nbsp; I
must not be too hard, however, on our friend; it is not quite
safe for glebe <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>tenants to differ from rectors as a rule.&nbsp; Three are
already on notice for differing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Higdon, having faced the alternatives of being
reprimanded for <i>not</i> closing the school or for allowing the
reverend gentleman from Shimpling to close it&mdash;you takes
your choice&mdash;went back to attend to her bairns considerably
chastened, and Burston breathed again as of yore.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only two Englishmen who could have done
justice to this theme are both dead.</p>
<p>Set to appropriate poetry by Gilbert, composed and
orchestrated with a slight Mozartean sprinkling of consecutive
fifths by Sir A. Sullivan, it might have brought down the house
at the Savoy, likewise the National Union of Teachers&rsquo;
Executive, had the N.U.T.S. not been suffering from sleeping
sickness.</p>
<p>However, the reverently-composed committee had not given up
all hopes, although the case was against them this time.</p>
<p>The next act opens with the appearance of Mr. Ikin,
assistant-secretary to the Norfolk Education Committee.&nbsp; He
paid what is known as a surprise visit.</p>
<p>A surprise visit is the most modern form of torture.</p>
<p>In the olden days they always brought you something.&nbsp;
To-day they try to take everything you&rsquo;ve got.&nbsp; In the
olden days you sometimes received a goose, to-day they send you a
picture postcard.</p>
<p>His surprise words to Mrs. Higdon were: &ldquo;What is wrong
between you and the managers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Higdon replied that she was not aware that there was
anything wrong.</p>
<p>Mr. Ikin went on to say that the local managers had written to
the Norfolk Education Committee, complaining that she had lighted
the schoolroom fire against their instructions, and that
&ldquo;as she had so many faults to find with the place, would
the committee kindly remove her to a sphere more
genial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That a good, healthy, religious enemy is not to be despised
the lives of Bruno, Galileo, Kepler, Wycliffe, Wesley, or a study
of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War will prove.</p>
<p>Here is a copy of the letter sent to Mrs. Higdon:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Norfolk Education
Committee,<br />
Shirehall, Norfolk,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">November 29th, 1913.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Burston and
Shimpling School</span>.</p>
<p>Dear Madam,&mdash;In a communication received from the
managers on the 13th of November, the committee were asked
&ldquo;if they will kindly remove Mrs. Higdon to a sphere more
genial.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>I may
remind you that this is the second place in which you have come
into conflict with the managers.</p>
<p>The committee have decided that the managers&rsquo;
instructions are to be obeyed, and as they have instructed you
that the fire is not to be lit, I am to give you directions to
obey these instructions.&nbsp; I trust there will be no further
friction.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours faithfully,<br />
Thos. A. Cox, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>
<p>Mrs. A. K. Higdon, Burston School, Diss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems the old method of fire-lighting still prevails.&nbsp;
That is by friction.</p>
<p>In reading this parochial letter of complaint one cannot help
but admire the warm interest which the Reverend Managers&rsquo;
Committee display in Mrs. Higdon.</p>
<p>They are so solicitous about her welfare that they desire the
Norfolk Education Committee to &ldquo;kindly remove her to a
sphere more genial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One is here tempted to quote Ingersoll&rsquo;s advice to his
wife.&nbsp; Once upon a day, when the lady was suffering from
heat in the head&mdash;vulgarly termed temper&mdash;he turned to
her, and mildly remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling, I am afraid that you have not yet shed all
your Christian virtues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reverend chairman, with Machiavellian
subtlety, omits to mention whether the &ldquo;genial
sphere&rdquo; to which he recommends Mrs. Higdon&rsquo;s removal
is on this planet or the other one.</p>
<p>The many readers of Pickwick will have vivid recollections of
the memorable part played by a warming pan, but who would believe
that a similar amount of indignation could be aroused in the
breasts of the Reverend Managers&rsquo; Committee at the lighting
of a schoolroom fire to dry the wet clothes of the agricultural
labourers&rsquo; children.&nbsp; The great difficulty one is
confronted with in placing these items before the general public
is to convince folks that these complaints were made against
Council School teachers and not High Church ones.&nbsp; These
backstairs, intriguing, silly, childish complaints might well be
laughed out of court if they were not being launched with a
definite object in view.&nbsp; That object was to strike at
Higdon through his wife.</p>
<p>This is a very ancient pastime.&nbsp; Satan, by all accounts,
was an early exponent of it.&nbsp; He had a similar object in
view, <i>viz.</i>, to assist emigration and check sympathetic
vibration.</p>
<p>Readers may have noted the paragraph: &ldquo;This is the
second place in which you have come into conflict with the
managers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>To
understand this sentence is to possess the key to all the petty
persecution and to gain a grip upon the problems of the
countryside.</p>
<p>Mr. Higdon has constantly, at Wood Dalling, his previous
place, and at Burston, tried to secure brighter conditions of
life and better housing for the tillers and toilers.</p>
<h3>WHERE ARE THE &ldquo;NUTS&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>He has been an ardent advocate of the Agricultural
Labourers&rsquo; Union.&nbsp; He and his wife are both members of
the N.U.T. to-day, and have been during the past eight
years.&nbsp; Mrs. Higdon was this year made honorary member by
her Association, East Dereham, in order to ensure her continuance
of her qualification for support could she not afford to pay.</p>
<p>In order to relieve the anxiety of a few up-to-date doubting
Thomases I here insert certificate of membership:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">No. 44,784.</p>
<p>Received of Mrs. Higdon (1913), of Burston, Diss., following
amounts on behalf of N.U.T. and the East Dereham Association.</p>

<p>Mr. Higdon&rsquo;s 1914 membership card is 41,534.&nbsp; He
possesses similar receipts right up to date.</p>
<p>In order also to relieve the minds of a few gentlemen who know
so much <i>that is not so</i>, Mr. and Mrs. Higdon have not
received one penny piece from the &ldquo;nuts&rdquo; of the
N.U.T. Executive.&nbsp; They have taught during the last sixteen
months without fee, and the villagers, having understudied
Elijah&rsquo;s raven, have, out of their humble cupboards,
supplied the Higdons.&nbsp; Pardon this digression.</p>
<p>Now to come to the root cause of the persecutions.</p>
<p>Those in authority like not the cold, clear light of public
opinion to be focussed upon their apathy and neglect.</p>
<p>For centuries have squire and parson held the countryside in
subjection.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye shall know them by their
fruits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Low standards of living, emigration, insanitary hovels, and
servility&mdash;these are the fruits.&nbsp; The Parish Council
Elections, both at Wood Dalling and Burston, gave the <i>owners
of the people&rsquo;s lives</i> a severe shock.</p>
<p>At each place, Assistant-Master Higdon and the agricultural
labourers topped the poll.&nbsp; At Burston, Higdon defeated the
very <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Reverend Rector, C. T. Eland.&nbsp; An unpardonable
offence.&nbsp; He topped the poll, and with him five labourers
were elected, thus displacing the parson and the
landowners.&nbsp; After these victories, the persecutions
commenced, both at Wood Dalling and Burston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Tubal, fee me an officer, I will have the heart of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am also proud to add that in spite of the most strenuous (or
strenuseless) opposition, spite of clergy and farmers&rsquo;
malice, Higdon and his friends have carried their housing
agitation to victory&mdash;the Local Government Board having just
given their decision in favour of the Burston Parish Council
against the District Council, that the houses must be proceeded
with forthwith.&nbsp; No wonder the villagers are gratified.</p>
<p>Often have the younger end to wait until their elders die off
ere they can get married, and the funeral-baked meats oft furnish
the Matrimonial Passover.</p>
<p>When we learn of people crowded in small sleeping rooms, and
Barnardo children occupying one-storied insanitary hovels, with
outside walls only seven feet high, and damp rooms on ground
floor, unfit for sleeping in, we may easily guess the fight the
schoolmaster had to make.</p>
<p>Strange is it not that gentlemen living in the best house in
the village&mdash;as clergymen generally do&mdash;should be such
strong opponents of good homes for other Christians?</p>
<p>The only faults Mrs. Higdon had to find at school were simply
faults which every lady inhabiting a house would seek to
remedy.&nbsp; Faults of lighting, heating, drainage, and
schoolhouse pump which were essential matters to the health of
even labourers&rsquo; offspring.</p>
<p>The reverend manager and his local committee, however,
objected.</p>
<p>The schoolroom fire was lit upon wet mornings to dry the
children&rsquo;s clothes, as the third radiator of the heating
apparatus did not sufficiently warm the room.&nbsp; The Reverend
Eland visited the school and the mistress explained to him her
reasons for lighting this fire occasionally.&nbsp; Strange to
say, he agreed with her, and advised her to write Mr. Wade, of
Shimpling.&nbsp; He not replying (according to his usual
practice) silence was taken as consent.</p>
<p>Not before a new body of managers was formed, with the
reverend gentleman, who had previously given his permission as
chairman (C. T. Eland), was the complaint <i>re</i> fire
re-resurrected.</p>
<p>So much for the fire, the whole fire, and nothing but the
fire, so help your wet clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trivialities oft usher in tragedies,
however.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>WHAT
&ldquo;JOHN BULL&rdquo; HAD TO SAY.</h3>
<p>The next complaint was more successful.&nbsp; Mrs. Higdon was
accused of caning two Barnardo children, discourtesy to the
managers, and our dear old friendly complaint, fire-lighting,
once more.&nbsp; These complaints, like the previous ones, were
completely false and unfounded.&nbsp; During these complaints
Mrs. Higdon was helping the reverend gentleman with his lantern
entertainments.</p>
<p><i>John Bull</i>, referring to the matter, says: &ldquo;The
role of scape-goat was reserved for the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the last election the schoolmaster, with five labourers of
his own way of thinking, was triumphantly returned to the Parish
Council.&nbsp; Room was made for them by the unseating of the
rector and the leading farmers.&nbsp; In these striking
circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that the managers of
the school should have entreated the County Education Committee
to remove them &ldquo;to a more genial sphere of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An early opportunity was found to charge her with the
ill-treatment of two of her pupils and&mdash;whisper it with
bated breath&mdash;&ldquo;intentional discourtesy to the
rector&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That two respectable teachers should be hounded out of house
and home simply upon the testimony of a poor Barnardo
waif&mdash;who privately denied what she publicly confessed,
excusing herself by saying &ldquo;she would have been thrashed by
her foster-mother if she had not said so&rdquo; seems beyond
belief.</p>
<p>Still the fact remains that Mrs. Higdon did not cane the
child, as the whole of the school children can prove.&nbsp; She
does not belong to the cane family.&nbsp; Furthermore, the sequel
to this complaint proves her entire innocence.&nbsp; Pity,
indeed, is it that those who were seeking excuses for her removal
could not find a <i>single</i> parent or child belonging to the
village to complain of Mrs. Higdon&rsquo;s treatment of them.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the head teacher has been discourteous to the
managers.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; (<i>a</i>) That in view of the direct conflict of
evidence with respect to the caning of the Barnardo children they
are not able to give a decision on this matter; but they are
strongly of opinion that there is no evidence at all that the
girl (E.C.) is mentally and morally deficient, or a danger to the
school, as stated in the letters of the head teacher and her
husband.&nbsp; (The head teacher said she was
&ldquo;<i>somewhat</i>&rdquo; mentally deficient, which, of
course, alters the context).</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; That, in their opinion, these children are
well treated and cared for by their foster-mother, and that the
children are not afraid of being beaten by her.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; That in their opinion the communications sent
by the head teacher and her husband to Dr. Barnardo&rsquo;s
Institution were not warranted by the facts of the case.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>The
sub-committee, after most carefully reviewing the whole of the
evidence, advise: &ldquo;That it is to the interest of elementary
education in this village that the head teacher should seek other
employment with as little delay as possible.&nbsp; That no
punishment book having been kept in this school by the head
teacher prior to this occurrence she be directed faithfully to
keep such book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the forces of reaction had triumphed.&nbsp; First, accused
and condemned by false stories put in the mouths of babes, eight
and nine years&rsquo; old respectively; secondly, because the
Higdons had written to the Barnardo Institution hoping to receive
real justice from an impartial tribunal, not local village
justice; thirdly, insulted about an ancient rule of Sir John
Gorst&rsquo;s <i>re</i> punishment book, which other teachers in
the county did not possess.&nbsp; Thus they were supposed to have
received their quietus.</p>
<p>The inquiry was practically a funless farce.&nbsp; Higdon and
his wife received short notice to vacate the schoolhouse (left in
the lurch by the N.U.T., as at Wood Dalling and at Burston, where
the representative, after promising that a slander action would
take place as soon as possible, became frightened at his own
bravery, and thought better of it), they felt inclined to
understudy poor Joe, and move on.</p>
<p>At this juncture all seemed lost.&nbsp; The Higdons, poor
financially and politically, having no rich Liberal nor Tory
champion, were confronted with that &ldquo;remove to a sphere
more genial,&rdquo; which their most Christian friends
desired.</p>
<p>The Burston Dyaks seemed to have succeeded, when all at once a
change came o&rsquo;er the scene.&nbsp; Here entereth the school
children.&nbsp; Not meaningless are the beautiful words, &ldquo;A
little child shall lead them.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE CHILDREN STRIKE.</h3>
<p>The school children struck.&nbsp; They refused to attend the
Council School.&nbsp; When they knew their beloved teachers had
been victimised they refused to go back.&nbsp; They went on
strike.</p>
<p>This was the finest, spontaneous, and most loving act of
kindness that kind teachers ever had showered upon them.&nbsp; It
was a fitting tribute and a real answer to all the calumny and
slander.</p>
<p>Children know when they are loved.&nbsp; They cannot pretend
as grown-ups can.&nbsp; Had Higdon and his wife been disciples of
Whackford Squeers or advocates of the &ldquo;Big Stick,&rdquo;
the children would gladly have sung Tosti&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good-bye
for ever,&rdquo; and good shuttance.&nbsp; But they struck in
sympathy.</p>
<p>Here are we confronted with another great factor.&nbsp; The
mothers backed them up womanfully.&nbsp; There are at present 56
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>children
on Higdons&rsquo; books.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a juxtaposition, as
the late-lamented Dominie Sampson might have remarked.&nbsp; The
Babes o&rsquo; Burston and the Burston Braves.</p>
<p>That the women showed bravery is an undeniable fact.&nbsp; It
requires more than milksop pluck to brave the farmers, the
clerics, and the law.</p>
<p>An open-air meeting was held on the green.&nbsp; The village
green is that portion of England left over after the squire and
parson have cast lots for the remainder.</p>
<p>What says the good book, slightly altered?&nbsp; &ldquo;A
certain man went to Jericho and fell among landowners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here let me insert the villagers&rsquo; reply to the Reverend
Managers&rsquo; Committee and the Norfolk Education
Committee:</p>
<blockquote><p>That we, the electors and ratepayers of Burston
and Shimpling, in peaceable meeting assembled on Burston Common,
again protest against the action of certain school managers in
bringing about the dismissal of the teachers, Mr. and Mrs.
Higdon, whom we all desire to keep; we who are parents have been
more than satisfied with the educational progress during the past
three years; the children have liked going to school, and have
been more regular in their attendances than ever before; the
report of His Majesty&rsquo;s Inspector is a most excellent one,
so that upon no grounds whatever can we see any reasonable excuse
for the removal of these teachers from the school.</p>
<p>The children wrote essays upon these exciting incidents.&nbsp;
I have read them.&nbsp; They have given me great joy.&nbsp; Some
are quite dramatic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Night
Before the Strike</span>.<br />
By a Strike Boy.</p>
<p>The night before we went on strike we had a meeting on the
comon.&nbsp; (Nothing common about <i>his</i> spelling is
there?)&nbsp; Mr. Durbridge, who is a soldier now, had two lamps
a light.&nbsp; All the children goin&rsquo; on strike.&nbsp; Went
into a ring and held there hands up.&nbsp; So we all went into
the ring.&nbsp; There were 66 children.&nbsp; The last night we
went to the Council School we all had a Easter egg each and a
orange each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were Mrs. Higdon&rsquo;s parting gifts to the
children.&nbsp; But she has not parted from them yet (Glory be!)
and this was over sixteen months ago.</p>
<p>Other essays tell us how &ldquo;the strikers marched with
flags and banners, with cards on their breasts, &lsquo;We want
our teachers back.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>One boy writes &ldquo;that God sent fine weather a purpose for
us strikers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope he did, sonny.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Another
states &ldquo;how they marched round the
candlestick.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a route march which consists of
a twist and a double to pass the Council School and the Rectory,
although there is no mention of the children being invited in to
tea.</p>
<p>We gain information from these essays, &ldquo;as to bobies
standing round.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evidently this boy has studied
un-Natural History.</p>
<p>We also learn &ldquo;how Mrs. Boulton brought a pale of
lemonade and nuts, and we sang &lsquo;We will all cling together
like the ivy on the old garden wall,&rsquo; and we have done so
except two Turncote blacklegs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not white Wyandottes,
blacklegs.</p>
<p>Another budding Jim Mace perchance (for James hailed from
&ldquo;Swarfham where they do tree days&rsquo; trashin&rsquo; for
norfun&rsquo;&rdquo;) informs us &ldquo;that they had three or
four policemen to gaurd the school, but (as he quaintly remarks)
<i>there was no need</i> for <i>them as we did not get to
fighting</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evidently a good job for the policemen
that Jack did not tackle them.</p>
<p>Yes, I have had great joy of these essays.&nbsp; Amy informs
us &ldquo;how she brought her mouth organ and Violet brought her
accordeon, and how those Barnardo girls told stories, for they
had not been caned.&rdquo;&nbsp; One feels quite young as one
reads of &ldquo;Ben Turner borrowing two planks to write upon,
how schoolmistress, whom they term governess, would come and
catch us not redein, an&rsquo; we would have to do a slate full
of trancription&rdquo;&mdash;whatever that may mean.</p>
<p>One may read, mark, and learn &ldquo;how the boys sat on
planks with their legs in the ditch,&rdquo; and &ldquo;how when
it was sewing day, we sat on the copper in the coal-house, and
when it raned we ranned into the cottage,&rdquo; and &ldquo;how
we had our liteness tooken twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But some of the essays are grand and reflect credit upon all
concerned.&nbsp; To read them brings back youthful days.</p>
<h3>A SCHOOL ON THE COMMON.</h3>
<p>So the children were taught on the Common.&nbsp; They had
their old teachers, who taught as a labour of love and without
fee.&nbsp; They received in return a few eggs, a little milk,
butter, cheese, in fact, anything which poor people share with
each other, not forgetting Burston smiles.</p>
<p>However, trouble was a-brewing.&nbsp; The Law Assyrian came
down like a wolf on the fold.&nbsp; The parents were summoned for
not sending their children to school.&nbsp; On the 14th of May,
1914, thirty parents appeared before the magistrates at Diss,
three miles away, to show cause whereby, inasmuch, as aforesaid,
likewise <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>hereinafter.&nbsp; Why not!&nbsp; Oh, Law!&nbsp;
Lor!&nbsp; Perhaps you have had experience of engaging a lawyer
to defend you from another lawyer?</p>
<p>The Burston Braves appeared before the Diss Solons for not
sending their children to school.</p>
<p>I pause here to blame the children.&nbsp; Had the children
been intelligent enough to choose rich parents they could have
been taught in their own homes, including Windsor, Knowsley,
Welbeck, or anywhere else.&nbsp; Rich parents have this slight
advantage over Burston village bairns.&nbsp; Let this be a
warning to the bairns.</p>
<p>The solicitor for the defence questioned the School Attendance
Officer, who admitted that <i>he</i> had made no inquiries to
ascertain whether the children were attending another school.</p>
<p>By the way, what did that well-known writer say, whose name I
do not know?&nbsp; &ldquo;Man is an animal that looks above,
behind, but never beneath his nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attendance officer had nothing to say on behalf of the
Education Committee as to the efficiency of the old teachers.</p>
<p>The magistrates heard <i>one</i> case.&nbsp; The Burston Brave
proved that her little son had regularly attended a school
conducted by the late mistress and master, so the bench inflicted
a fine of five shillings upon her and 29 more women.&nbsp; These
are hard wooden benches, aren&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; I wonder what
fine would have been inflicted if the children had not attended
school!</p>
<p>But, knowing their antipathy to blacklegging, they could not
do otherwise than stick to their old teachers.</p>
<p>In the certificate of membership, issued by the National Union
of Teachers, is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Professional Conduct</span>.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the actions already declared to be
unprofessional:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; For any member to take an appointment from which, in
the judgment of the N.U.T. Executive, another member has been
unjustly dismissed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How could the children attend the Council School then, when
the N.U.T.E. had allowed this case to go by default?&nbsp;
However, the Braves and Babes of Burston marched back to the
school, pondering on Diss Law.</p>
<p>Speaking without bias, as the bowler said, I am thoroughly in
favour of magistrates being chosen by the shape of their heads,
instead of by the size of their wallets.&nbsp; Fancy mulcting
poor labourers&rsquo; wives (to some of whom one sovereign is a
princely week&rsquo;s salary) of 5s. each.</p>
<h3><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>FINED
BUT UNDISMAYED.</h3>
<p>They were fined again and again.&nbsp; But they held
indignation meetings on Burston Green.&nbsp; Lovers of fair play
and freedom flocked in, the money was collected, and the fines
paid.&nbsp; They refused to crook the pregnant hinges of the
knee.&nbsp; Their children should not return to Council Block,
whilst old England stands upon a rock, unless proper inquiry was
held, and the teachers re-instated.&nbsp; The opposition has
simply strengthened their resolves.&nbsp; A little kindness, a
little Christian charity, a little of the spirit of give and take
in the early stages, and all would have been better than
well.&nbsp; To-day, however, to deny men and women who, out of
their daily toil, pay for education, etc., a voice in the
management of what concerns them nearly and dearly is simply
autocratic presumption.&nbsp; Harassed by law, denied the right
to choose those whom they loved to teach their children, they
determined not to be coerced.&nbsp; They refused to attend the
churches or chapels.&nbsp; They held huge demonstrations upon the
village green.&nbsp; The surrounding villagers and townsfolk came
to hear and see.&nbsp; So the revolt spreads.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those
who came to scoff oft remained to pray.&rdquo;&nbsp; Real, live
addresses were given by friends, who reanimated the hopes of the
past, crystallised the spirit of the dead Christ, and made hearts
throb and eyes fill as they vividly brought before others the
poor, persecuted, maligned, crucified friend of fishermen,
Magdalen, and poor folks.&nbsp; The village green blossomed; the
dream of brotherhood, fellowship, and fraternity, as prophesied
by murdered John Ball&mdash;the so-called mad priest of
Kent&mdash;became reality.</p>
<p>John Sutton, sheep dipper, baptised the children.&nbsp; John
was also christened.&nbsp; Christened after his Christian name,
he became John the Baptist.</p>
<p>Higdon and his wife and the villagers hunted around to find
some lowly shelter for the little mites, some of whom had come
from miles away to be taught.&nbsp; They found one at last.&nbsp;
A blind man took pity on them.&nbsp; He let a carpenter&rsquo;s
shop to them.</p>
<p>A carpenter&rsquo;s shop!&nbsp; And where on earth may we
discover a school for budding humanity so pregnant with meaning
as a humble carpenter&rsquo;s shop?</p>
<p>Surely no palace grand, no poplar-dwarfing sun-kissed steeple,
no Moslem mosque gold glittering in Eastern city, contains such
deep meanings to reverent minds as a carpenter&rsquo;s
shop.&nbsp; No ancient mausoleum, no Egyptian pyramid, containing
swathed mummy bones of ancient Pharoah, who scuttled through
life&rsquo;s short day, may call forth such sentiments, or
inspiration to die if need be on behalf of the poor and the
needy, the homeless and friendless.&nbsp; So to this humble shop
came the children.&nbsp; Here <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>came the boys and girls who had
struck against Council Syntax and Burston Junkerism.</p>
<p>They were helped by their mothers.&nbsp; If the lot of the
agricultural labourer, the Lazarus of civilisation, is hard, the
lot of the labourers&rsquo; labourer is harder still.&nbsp;
Little joy in life has she.&nbsp; Divorced from the beauties of
science and art, no electric lights, no hot and cold water on the
slopstone, no airy, fairy, decorated bedrooms, no well paved and
lighted streets, no quick transit, no musical evenings,
scientific lectures, melodious operas, sweet string bands, no
cinema, no long cycle.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Grinding toil.&nbsp; Dark,
slushy, snowy lanes in winter, grime and poverty, poor wages,
daily struggles, patching and mending, sewing and knitting,
washing and baking, sometimes toiling and moiling in rain-swept
fields for bare pittance, wearing sodden shoddy, or soaking on
wind-swept wastes.&nbsp; Go to Burston and meet your sisters,
keeping up their hearts on miserable wages, and even giving out
of their scant doles a little offering to their beloved strike
school.</p>
<p>With scarce a copper to bless themselves with, they rented the
carpenter&rsquo;s shop at &pound;3 per year.&nbsp; Out o&rsquo;
poorly furnished homes they gave their chairs, their tables,
stools, lamps, knick-knacks, of little value perhaps, but potent
as widows&rsquo; mite.&nbsp; They cleaned, scrubbed, scoured, and
mothered that school, as they are doing it to-day.</p>
<p>Lucky scholars to have so much mother-love enveloping
them!&nbsp; To have such mem&rsquo;ries clustering round.&nbsp;
To think that the world&rsquo;s toiler, sweet son o&rsquo; Mary,
spent His early college days in the carpenter&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp;
Was He not apprenticed to manual labour?&nbsp; Did He not
sanctify it?&nbsp; May He not have rehearsed future discourses
and similar surroundings, whilst sawing and planing, mending,
making, and creating in His self-chosen University of Adversity,
so that He might humanise the world, the world which to-day is
deaf to His teachings.&nbsp; Had His parables, His philosophy of
honest poverty, His contempt of lordship and riches been laid to
heart, Europe would not be in flames to-day.</p>
<p>And, as my labour of love draws to a close, I grieve to say
that trouble is coming to Burston village once more.&nbsp; The
rector has given notice to three of the glebe tenants.&nbsp; The
blind man, who let the carpenter&rsquo;s shop, is one.&nbsp; This
means the closing down of the school.&nbsp; Two other parents are
also in similar plight, and this is a presage of further
victimisation perchance in the future.</p>
<p>Shall all the anxieties, the struggles, and the hopes of the
past sixteen months end in this clearance of the Higdons and
their friends, the closing of the carpenter&rsquo;s shop, shall
it end like this?&nbsp; If so, I do not envy the rector his
victory.&nbsp; Nay, rather do I think it <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>will not only
be a barren one, but a distinct blow against the religion he is
supposed to represent.&nbsp; What Christianity is this?</p>
<h3>A BISHOP&rsquo;S ADVICE.</h3>
<p>Three people have received notice to quit the globe.&nbsp; The
Bishop of Norwich has been appealed to.&nbsp; The <i>Eastern
Daily Press</i>, July 28th, 1915, which lies on my knee as I
write, contains his photo.&nbsp; He is standing outside the
Hospital for the Indigent Blind, in Magdalen Street, Norwich,
with the Earl and Countess of Leicester, looking as though he had
his meals more regularly than many village folk.</p>
<p>Surely he is interested in the blind of Burston, also?&nbsp;
Shall they be ousted?&nbsp; Will he allow his rector to press
this injustice?&nbsp; But he has been appealed to.&nbsp; Here is
his reply:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">The Palace,<br />
Norwich.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I am directed by the Bishop of Norwich to
acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th, and to say that
if the persons named feel aggrieved they should seek redress
through the legal tribunals.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours faithfully,<br />
J. A. Parsons, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>
<p>E. B. Reeves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So His Lordship, with income of &pound;4,500 per year, palace,
etc., advises three poor folk, one of whom is blind, to
&ldquo;seek redress through the legal tribunals.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This be certainly His Lordship&rsquo;s grim joke.&nbsp; How poor
folk, waxing lean and keeping families on between &pound;40 and
&pound;50 per year, sometimes feasting on bread and lard, whilst
glebe owners munch biscuits and cream, can indulge in such luxury
as &ldquo;<i>The Law</i>&rdquo; passes what Darby Doyle would
call &ldquo;the wit av mortial man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only law we can appeal to under these circumstances is the
Law of Humanity.&nbsp; The ancient tribunal, <i>vox populi</i>,
<i>vox Dei</i>: The voice of the people is the voice of God.</p>
<p>I would that these people had better advocate than
myself.&nbsp; Their cause is founded on justice, reason, and
truth.&nbsp; They want public inquiry which, I believe, will end
in their well-beloved teachers reinstatement.&nbsp; The tyranny
of the countryside is still a menace to freedom of thought and
action.&nbsp; I have done my best to explain this.</p>
<p>To the Braves of Burston I tender my appreciation and
admiration for their gallant sixteen months&rsquo;
struggle.&nbsp; They are the pioneers.&nbsp; They are real live
women, with red corpuscles dancing in their veins, not the
phagocytes of serfdom.&nbsp; None but James Oppenheim, the poet,
may do them justice:</p>
<h3><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span><span
class="smcap">Bread and Roses</span>.</h3>
<p class="poetry">As we come marching, marching, in the beauty of
the day<br />
A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts grey<br />
Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses<br
/>
For the people hear us singing, &ldquo;Bread and Roses, Bread and
Roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">As we come marching, marching, unnumbered women
dead<br />
Go crying thro&rsquo; our singing, their ancient song of
bread.<br />
Small art, and love, and beauty, their drudging spirits knew;<br
/>
Yes! &rsquo;tis bread we fight for, but we fight for roses,
too.</p>
<p class="poetry">As we come marching, marching, we bring the
greater days,<br />
The rising of the women means the rising of the race.<br />
No more the drudge and idler, ten that toil where one reposes<br
/>
But a sharing of life&rsquo;s glories, &ldquo;Bread and
Roses,&rdquo; Bread and Roses.</p>
<p>And you, chance reader, may be able, even in a small way, to
focus the light of public opinion by either voice, pen, spoken
word, or this booklet, upon this grave miscarriage of
justice.</p>
<h3>WHAT ARE <i>YOU</i> GOING TO DO?</h3>
<p>The time is quickly drawing nigh.&nbsp; Michaelmas Day,
September 29th, 1915, sees the expiration of the glebe
notices.&nbsp; Trades Councils, Brotherhoods, Co-operative
Guilds, Associations of all kinds may help in this matter.&nbsp;
Our brothers are laying down their lives in Flanders to preserve
that heritage of the ages, Freedom.&nbsp; We want that freedom in
Burston.&nbsp; The people require freedom to worship God in their
own way.&nbsp; Freedom to have their children taught by those
whom they love.&nbsp; Freedom to remain in the villages where
their fathers died, and not to be ousted at the caprice of every
gentleman whom they do not see eye to eye with.</p>
<p>Freedom is a goddess worth dying for.&nbsp; Here I express the
thanks of the Higdons, and the Babes and Braves o&rsquo; Burston,
to the many friends who have risen up.</p>
<p>A cynic once said, &ldquo;Gratitude is a lively sense of
favours to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Granted&mdash;and why not?</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
recipient confers a pleasure in accepting.&nbsp; Our hearts are
still full of hopes of help in the near future.&nbsp; The Trade
Union Congress meets in September.&nbsp; Maybe we shall find more
friends there.&nbsp; To E. B. Reeves, of The Bungalow, Norwich, I
tender thanks.&nbsp; As Robert Louis Stevenson puts it, &ldquo;He
is a bonnie fechter&rdquo; for freedom, vigilant, tireless,
painstaking.&nbsp; To the many noble speakers thanks also.</p>
<p>Offers of help, orders for this pamphlet, friendly
suggestions, and letters of advice will find him at the address:
E. B. Reeves, The Bungalow, Norwich.</p>
<p>The fight after all is a real fight for &ldquo;Bread and
Roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same year that Calvin died Shakespeare came on
earth.&nbsp; It was a real good exchange without any robbery.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
